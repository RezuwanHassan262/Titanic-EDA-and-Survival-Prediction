# Practice work: Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis and Survival Prediction
This project aims to investigate the factors (Age, Class, Gender, etc)that contributed to survival in the tragic sinking of the Titanic and predict the survival chances of passengers based on some provided features.

This was the dataset [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv).

The Titanic's sinking remains one of history's most infamous maritime tragedies. This project explores the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and factors influencing passengers' survival chances and tries to predict a passenger's survival chance based on those factors using different machine learning models.


This repository seeks to offer a detailed examination of the key variables involved. The features present in the dataset are,

1. PassengerId
2. Survived (target variable)
3. Pclass (passenger class)
4. Name
5. Sex
6. Age
7. SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)
8. Parch (number of parents/children aboard)
9. Ticket
10. Fare
11. Cabin
12. Embarked (port of embarkation)


## Analysis and Workflow

**Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values, fixing data types, and preparing the dataset for further analysis.  

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using descriptive statistics and visualizations to examine variable distributions and uncover relationships.  

**Feature Engineering:** Developing new features or modifying existing ones to represent the patterns within the data better.  

**Statistical Analysis:** Pinpointing key factors that have a significant impact on survival outcomes.  

**Survival Prediction:** Applying various machine learning models to estimate a passenger's likelihood of survival based on these factors.

6. There are 3 three features/columns that are directly correlated with the World Rank of the universities. Those are, H-Index, CItations & Number of Publications.
7. As world rank increases, The H-Index decreases.
